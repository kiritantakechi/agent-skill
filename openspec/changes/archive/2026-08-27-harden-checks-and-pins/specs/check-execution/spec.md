## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: The executing tool is named, pinned, and required

Every tool the harness depends on to decide whether a check passes SHALL be named in the standard,
pinned to an exact version, and treated as a required dependency rather than an assumed one. Its
absence SHALL be reported by the same mechanism that reports any other missing required tool.

The declared pin SHALL be verified against reality in two directions. The version that actually
executes SHALL be compared against the pin, and a mismatch SHALL be reported — a statement that the
standard was verified against a version is false if the harness ran a different one. The pin SHALL
also be compared against the newest release of that tool, and a superseded pin SHALL be reported, so
that moving a pin is a reviewed event rather than a note nobody reads.

#### Scenario: The harness runs where the tool is missing

- **WHEN** verification runs in an environment without a required tool
- **THEN** it reports the tool as unavailable and the affected checks as not run

#### Scenario: A reader adopts a Check

- **WHEN** a reader copies a Check to run against their own code
- **THEN** the standard has told them which tool to install and which version it was verified
  against

#### Scenario: The running version is not the pinned version

- **WHEN** the tool that executes is a different version from the one the pin declares
- **THEN** it is reported as a failure, whichever direction the difference runs, because every claim
  the standard makes about what was verified rests on the two agreeing

#### Scenario: The pin cannot be found

- **WHEN** a tool the harness requires has no pin to compare against
- **THEN** that is itself the finding; an unfindable pin SHALL NOT be read as agreement

#### Scenario: A newer release of a pinned tool exists

- **WHEN** the tool's newest released version is higher than the pinned one
- **THEN** it is reported, naming the available version and what moving the pin requires

#### Scenario: The release list cannot be consulted

- **WHEN** the newest released version cannot be determined — no network, or the index does not
  answer
- **THEN** it is reported as not run rather than as up to date
